<p>My Carrer choice: I would like to do any carrer that involves computers or just technology in general.
I have a passion for technology and everything about it. I really like in this time how much we have accomplished,
how we have so many things that we ourselves do not realize. To work for a general company you need at least 2 years of basic knowledge 
for the task at hand. The best pay in this area range is $100,000 a year or more</p>
